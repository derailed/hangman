# Hangman Istio Style

This is an implementation of the traditional game of Hangman. This application
is broken into 3 separate web services:

* Dictionary Service which produces random word generation
* Game Service which tracks the game state
* Hangman Service

This application is driven via a cli which connects to the Hangman service which
tracks game progress and status.

This demo application is deployed via Kubernetes and leverage an Istio
service mesh to orchestrate the cluster and manage inter-service communication by
dialing various knobs.
